                Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to swtich to door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)
                <br /><br />
                This simulator runs the scenario repeatedly, showing that it's advantageous to switch your choice every time. The longer the simulator runs, theoretically, the closer to 66.66% the chance will be that you win the car if you switch.
